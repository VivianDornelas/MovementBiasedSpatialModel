# Spatial Population Modeling: Movement Biases towards Attractive Regions

This repository contains code for a reaction-advection-diffusion model designed to numerically solve the spatial density distribution of a population in heterogeneous landscapes. This implementation incorporates individual movement behavior influenced by landscape features, including preferences for specific regions and avoidance of degraded habitats.
